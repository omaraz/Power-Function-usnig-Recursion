# Power-Function-usnig-Recursion
It is a simple program to apply the recursion concept using a power function.

Recursion is an important concept it is the process in which a function calls itself directly or indirectly is called recursion and the corresponding function is called as recursive function.
We used this concept in the power function ,but be aware that the recursion causes overhead time and space but it is much easier to implement than loops.

This code to work on GCC or the new version like Visual Studio or CodeBlocks may need some changes.
